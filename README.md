# Dodging_the_blocks
This is a 2D video game made in Python using the pygame module. The player is supposed to race the car(left and right movement available using right and left arrow keys) so as to dodge the blocks that keep falling from above. A window prompting the user to play or quit is added in the beginning. A window prompting the user to play again or quit is displayed on crashing. Pause functionality is also added(by clicking 'p' key).Record of current score and highest score is also displayed on the window.
